# Ski Patrol Emergency Number

[日本語版 Readme](./Readme-ja.md)

## Introduction

If you are an experienced skier or snowboarder, you probably have had an opportunity to call patrols of the snow resort. At that time, did you prepare the emergency phone number in advance? Or could you find it easily and made a phone call to them?

Yes, in fact, I had fallen into this situation several times. But I had not prepared it at all. At those times, I luckily found people who are willing to help the injured guy with me. Or that was when I enjoyed skiing with my friends so we cloud split up to care him and to go down the slope to call patrols.

After struggling at the scenes of accidents several times, I found it difficult to find ski patrol's phone numbers quickly. I live in Japan and I ski only in Japan. Japanese snow resorts are very safety-oriented and I sometimes feel them even overprotective, but the accessibility to ski patrol is limited. Of course I know, I should have prepared the emergency phone number in the morning and start to get on the lift. And my friends of serious skiers make it a habit. But what if the ski patrol's phone number is not available? The printed piste map may not be found in your next ski trip. I dug so many Japanese ski resort's websites but only less than 10% of them clearly shows the patrol phone numbers.

Some smartphone apps for skiers or snowboarders may have an SOS call button. If you are a kind of skibum of 50+ days like me, install them. This is so nice but not all the people will install them.

So I started making a database to make the accessibility to ski patrols easier. You can find ski resorts phone numbers from your present location, beginners or experts. If those people who are not prepared for this kind of trouble face such a situation, they will google "ski patrol emergency number" with their smartphones. And I wish this database will help them.
